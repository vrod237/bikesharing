## What is the population of Des Moines? 
The population of Des Moines, Iowa is 214,237 (Ref ii) per the population estimate from July 1st 2019. The 2010 census lists the population as 203,433 (Ref ii); we should have an updated census soon but who knows how COVID-19 might affect the accuracy of it. But for this report, we'll run with the 2019 estimates.
## How does its population compare to the population of New York City? 
At a population of 214,237, it's fairly small compared to New York City which has a population of 8,336,817 per a 2019 estimate (Ref ii). This means that the total population of Des Moines is 2.57% of New York City's total population. Now we obviously do not want to have the same number of employees in Des Moines as we have in New York City, so we will be able to scale it down quite a bit. The smaller population in Des Moines means fewer employees, equipment, investment and easier management of the company for the city. Now, just because there's a much smaller population in Des Moines compared to New York City, that doesn't mean that the company cannot be successful.
## Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?
As mentioned above, a smaller population will result in fewer people using the bike sharing program. Des Moines could be the ideal place for the bike sharing program. The average commute for citizens, in Des Moines is 19 minutes, that's 22 minutes shorter than the average commute for citizens in New York City (Ref ii). Des Moines has a per capita income of $27,325 whereas New York City has a per capita income of $37,693 (Ref ii). Now what does this all mean? Des Moines has a lower overall income with shorter commutes, this is the perfect scenario to bring an afforable mode of transportation to a city. The bike sharing program would be a great alternative compared to owning a car, using the public transportation which has a set schedule and it is also healthier alternative. 

In terms of relative population, the population demographics suggest that Des Moines will have a higher percentage of population that use the bike sharing program compared to New York City. 

## Tourism in Des Moines
Des Moines already has a bike program available for tours around the city, which averages 40,000 rides a month (Ref iii). By adding the bike sharing program, this will allow the riders to use the bikes for methods outside of touring in addition to taking their own scenic routes around the city. With the bike tour being such a success, in addition to proving to be an great mode of transportation; adding the bike sharing program could be a great success. Also, as the capitol of Iowa, it has a various amount of minor league sports teams (Ref v) and also a number of popular tourist attractions (Ref iii).

## Weather
The hot season lasts for 3.8 months from May 24th to September 18th with an average daily temperature above 76 degrees (Ref iv). The cold season lasts for 3 months from November 27th to February 29th with an average daily temperature below 43 degrees (Ref iv). Outside of the cold season, weather allows for comfortable biking 9 months out of the year. But with commutes being shorter than NYC, Des Moinesians might be willing to ride in the cold weather for 19 minutes as opposed to over 40 minutes.

## Transportation
By implementing the Bike Sharing Program in Des Moines, this can help draw attention to the company. Instead of us reaching out to cities, cities may soon be reaching out to us. The program would reduce dependence on current public auto transportation as well as reduce gas emissions resulting in an eco-friendly option for transportation. Per 2018 numbers, transportation contrtibuted to 15% of total greenhouse gas emissions for Des Moines (Ref vi) bringing that down to under 10% would decrease outdoor air pollution which in turn would reduce premature deaths from poor air quailty (Ref vii).

## Conclusion
The bike sharing program would be relatively inexpensive and an easy-to-implement transportation option that can deliver a variety of benefits for Des Moines City. Due to the bike touring program, the city already has an abundance of bike lanes available for our bikes. However, it snows in Des Moines, during the winter, so it would be helpful to obtain some data regarding bike usage in New York City during the winter period. Although, the overall profit may not be as high as New York City, the market is strong potential for subscribers to make this a success in Des Moines.
