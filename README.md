## What is the population of Des Moines? 
The population of Des Moines, Iowa is 214,237 per the population estimate from July 1st 2019. The 2010 census lists the population as 203,433; we should have an updated census soon but who knows how COVID-19 might affect the accuracy of it. But for this report, we'll run with the 2019 estimates.
## How does its population compare to the population of New York City? 
At a population of 214,237, it's fairly small compared to New York City which has a population of 8,336,817 per a 2019 estimate. 
## Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?
